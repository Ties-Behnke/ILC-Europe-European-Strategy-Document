\section{\label{sec:RandD}R\&D strategy and achievements}

The capacity to reconstruct with extreme precision the characteristics of the ﬁnal states produced at the ILC is mandatory to take advantage of the inherently accurate knowledge of the scattering conditions of the beam particles. Moreover, the relatively mild running conditions allow alleviating the constraints on radiation tolerance and read-out speed. The R&D related to each sub-system was therefore driven by a challenging and innovative trade-oﬀ to be found between very demanding resolution (granularity) and material budget requirements on the one hand, and an acceptable speed and power consumption on the other hand. Moreover, the detector steering and read-out architectures obey speciﬁc conditions: they should be operated triggerless and designed to exploit the machine duty cycle and bunch spacing to mitigate the power consumption.
In several cases, individual performances targetted by the R&D could have been considered as nearly achieved outside of the ILC programme, but intensive R&D was needed to realise their combination at a level well beyond previous achievements, including detailed system integration aspects. In most cases, the R&D was aiming at an ordre of magnitude improvement w.r.t. the state-of-the-art. The prototyping undertaken for each experiment sub-system had as a ﬁnal goal to provide a realistic design with reliable performance and cost evaluation of the complete detector.
Overall, the R&D on highly segmented sub-systems composing the experimental set-up was guided by the need to reconstruct each particle composing the ﬁnal states using the so-called Particle Flow Approach (PFA). The performances demonstrated by the R&D were transfered to the Monte-Carlo description of the experiment used to predict the achievable experimental performances for each component of the physics programme.
The R&D was conducted by a large numbre of groups over many years. A wide variety of technological and design options could therefore be extensively explored. Technological alternatives were investigated for all sub-systems and were compared in terms of detection performances as well as for their cost. In most cases, these detection performances were evaluated on particle beams with system aspects directly transposable to the experiment. Some beam tests were performed inside a 2 T magnetic ﬁeld in ordre to validate the pulsed mode concept and the associated power saving.
Each calorimetre and tracking sub-system has been prototyped extensively, from small prototypes addressing all critical elements of a given sub-system up to a complete, real scale, prototype operated on beam, sometimes in combination with prototypes of other sub-systems composing the experiment. This allowed in particular to study and mature the PFA strategy with real input.
The development of tracking and vertexing devices was governed by the need of pixellated low material budget components allowing excellent momentum resolution and displaced vertices characterisation, including vertex charge, with performances exceeding typically by one ordre of magnitude those of existing experiments.
Two alternative approaches were investigated for the main tracker, one based on a TPC and one exploiting silicon sensors, possibly pixelated. The R&D for the TPC addressed mainly the single point resolution and ion feedback mitigation with diﬀerent micro-pattern read-out systems (MicroMegas, GEM, ...) and showed that the performance goals can indeed be reached, with a material budget of the end-caps not exceeding 30 % X0. The approach relying on silicon detectors concentrated on the material budget, showing that the targetted momentum resolution was within reach despite the restricted numbre of detector layers allowed to mitigate multiple scattering eﬀects. The necessary momentum resolution was shown to be reachable but the restricted numbre of layers had shortcomings in terms of tracking performances, calling for a large area pixelated Si tracker.
The R&D for the vertex detector explored the potential of several thin highly granular pixel technologies (CMOS, DEPFET, FPCCD, SoI, ...) which could oﬀer the ambitionned spatial resolution and material budget. Intensive eﬀort was invested in read-out systems allowing to cope with the hit density induced by the beam related background, resulting in performances depending on the technology and the read-out architecture.The concept of double-sided layers was also investigated with some technologies and established up to the level of being operated near an e+e− interaction point.
Most of the R&D eﬀort for the ILC detector concentrated on calorimetry, which required strategies promoting very compact and high granularity detection technologies connected to very low average power read-out micro-circuits complying with power pulsing. Major issues were addressed in CALICE, a consortium composed of more than 300 membres coming from more than 50 institutes.
The R&D for the EM calorimeter concentrated on optimised and cost eﬀective sensor systems, on the designs of a low power, pulsed, integrated readout electronics and an eﬀective thermal management and calibration strategy, and on ﬁnding a mechanical concept which combines large stability with minimal dead zones. A SiW based real size prototype was constructed and tested extensively on particle beams. The development of a more cost-eﬀective technological solution, based on a scintillator and photo-multiplier matrix was also realised and some of its performances compared to those of the SiW concept.
The HCAL prototyping was governed by the need for an eﬃcient and precise reconstruction of neutral hadron showers. Combined with stainless steel as conversion material, two read-out options were developed, one combining scintillator tiles with silicon photo-sensors read out with analog electronics, and an alternative approach based on gaseous devices (e.g. RPC) with higher segmentation but with signal encoding on one or two bits only.
The relative merits of the diﬀerent ECAL and HCAL options were in particular evaluated using combined test beam campaigns providing common data which were processed with PFA software which it allowed developing and assessing at the same time. The possibility to achieve the targetted energy and topology resolutions was demonstrated even when operated in power pulsed mode.
Substantial eﬀort was invested in developping technological solutions for the very forward calorimetres de-signed for robust electron and photon measurements used for integrated luminosity measurements and for bunch-to-bunch machine parameter monitoring. Satisfactory performances, including a radiation tolerance to 1 MGy, were obtained with tungsten absorber layers alternated with GaAs sensor planes read out with dedicated elec-tronics featuring a dual gain charge ampliﬁer providing a fast feedback for beam tuning.
Summarising, despite constrained ﬁnancial conditions, the proof of principle underlying each prominent sub-system of an experiment at the ILC has been completed. Most of the detector prototypes fabricated and tested allow exprapolating to the full detector performance and cost. Some technologies and detector concepts developed for the ILC have irrigated existing experiments in their construction of upgrade phase, which in turn provide a full size validation of technological approaches ﬁrst developed for the ILC. Further studies addressing system integration aspects are however still needed for some subsystems. The optimisation of the complete experimental design, though quite advanced, also still requires additional studies. The few years foreseen to ﬁnalise the decision and procedure of constructing the ILC will provide the necessary time to make the most appropriate technological choices for each sub-system and to complete the full R&D programme in due time.
