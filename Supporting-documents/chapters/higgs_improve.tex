{\color{red} JL: same here - better discuss in Higgs analyses section since we only do this for the Higgs analyses, not 2f and TGCs}

[improvement factors in S2*/S2: 10\% by better jet clustering algorithm; 
20\% by better flavor tagging algorithm; 20\% by 
including more decay modes in $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR(h\to WW*)$; a factor of 10 better $A_{LR}$
measurement by using $e^+e^-\to\gamma Z$ at ILC250; to be filled]
