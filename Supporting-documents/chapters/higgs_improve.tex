As elaborated in~\ref{sec:higgs}, all the estimates for Higgs measurements shown in
~\ref{tab:higgserrors} are based on available full simulation studies, which are performed using the analysis
techniques known at present. These estimates are clearly too conservative in the sense that we have not
been able to exploit all useful signal channels and more novel algorithms would be likely realized at the time
of taking ILC data. It is hence useful to give a bit optimistic prospects about how much we would improve. 
Following improvement factors are included in the optimistic scenario:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10\% by better jet clustering algorithm.
\item 20\% by better flavor tagging algorithm. 
\item 20\% by including more signal channels in $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR(h\to WW*)$. 
\item a factor of 10 better $A_{LR}$ measurement than today by using $e^+e^-\to\gamma Z$ at ILC250.
\end{itemize}
