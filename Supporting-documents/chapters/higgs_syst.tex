{\color{red} JL: not sure that we can pull this out of the previous sections. EG for the TGCs, the treatment of systematics is integral part of the extrapolation technique and cannot be separated out. 
We could discuss general assumptions, eg on polarisation and luminosity uncertainties *before* the individual analysis sections.}
