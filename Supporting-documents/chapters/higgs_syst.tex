The estimates shown in~\ref{tab:higgserrors} are only for statistical uncertainties. In the global fit,
following systematic uncertainties are imposed:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0.1\% from theory; applied to all $\sigma$ and $\sigma\cdot BR$ Higgs measurements.
\item 0.1\% from luminosity and beam polarization; 
applied to all $\sigma$ and $\sigma\cdot BR$ Higgs measurements.
\item 0.3\%$\times\sqrt{250/L}$ ($L$ for integrated luminosity in fb$^{-1}$) for b-tagging efficiency; 
applied to $\sigma\cdot BR(h\to b\bar{b})$ measurements.
\end{itemize}
Note in addition to the systematic uncertainties for Higgs measurement, 
in the global fit we also include systematic 
uncertainties for TGCs measurement; introduced in Section VIII.
