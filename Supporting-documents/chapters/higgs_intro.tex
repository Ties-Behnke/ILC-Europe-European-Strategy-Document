The compelling physics case in Section~\ref{sec:physics} is constructed 
based on a set of solid estimates for measurements of various observables at the ILC. 
The observables related to Higgs physics are outlined in Table~\ref{tab:higgserrors}, 
mostly $\sigma$ and $\sigma\cdot BR$ measurements
using the Higgs production processes shown in Fig.\ref{fig:HiggsProdILC},
 and will be explained in detail in this section. 
By solid it means that the estimates are obtained after having performed
full simulation of experimental physics analyses.

Section~\ref{sec:software} has introduced a few aspects of the full simulation
which can be defined as ``{\it detector simulation level}" and are absolutely essential: 
realistic interaction between each final state particle and 
and any part of the detector that the particle passes through, including new creation of
particles during the interaction; realistic algorithms for tracking,
particle flow analysis, vertex reconstruction and particle identification; 
resulting realistic performance of various detector resolutions for track momentum, jet energy,
and impact parameters, as well as of various efficiencies for tracking, flavor tagging, 
and isolated lepton finder. 

This section will introduce the other aspects of the full simulation which can be
defined as ``{\it event selection level}" and are mainly dealing with discrimination 
between signal and background events. As expected, the detailed strategies 
at the event selection level highly depend on what kind of observables we are going to
measure, and are elaborated in each of the following sub-sections. Before that, it is worth
emphasizing a few general features included in the full simulation analyses here
that are important to reach a solid estimate
and often are not well noticed or not fully captured in 
many fast simulation analyses in the literatures:
%{\color{red} JL: shouldn't the modelling of these be described in the software and MC sample chapter? We can mention them again here to rub the point in, of course, but the basic explanations ``[to be filled]'' should be in the previous chaper...}
%{JT: no, [to be filled] is not for "the basic explanations"}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it beamstrahlung and ISR}
are implemented in the event generators for both signal and background processes,
as introduced in previous section. These effects are important for estimation of 
signal and background contributions in the analyses that make use of the 
nominal value of center-of-mass energy. A representative example is seen in
Section~\ref{sec:higgs:sigmazh} Fig.~\ref{fig:RecoilMassLep250} for recoil
mass calculation: both beamstrahlung and ISR effects will drag signal events
from the more sensitive peak region to the less sensitive tail region, and meanwhile
will induce more background contribution in the signal region.
\item {\it overlay of beam background events} is implemented in every signal 
and background events. This will clearly affect the performance of 
reconstructed variables related to jets hence degrade the signal and background
discrimination. There is some method to remove partially the overlay, which will 
be introduced in next section. 
\item {\it full standard model background} is checked in all the analyses, 
in order not to miss any significant contribution. For example 2-fermion 
events after parton shower can well become background of 4-fermion signal.
For another example, often the background contribution in Higgs observables
comes from tail part of B-W structure for $Z$ propagator, hence neither neglecting 
$Z$ natural width nor ignoring similar diagram from $\gamma$ propagator is correct.
\item {\it realistic jet clustering and jet paring} algorithms often become the 
limiting factors for many of the analyses with $\ge 4$ jets in the signal final states.
The confusion between two color singlets, for instance $Z$ and $h$ in $\ee\to Zh\to 4 jets$,
could produce much wider spread on the reconstructed di-jet invariant masses 
than that by the pure detector resolution. Hence a simply smearing on di-jet mass
at parton level according to the detector resolution is often too optimistic. 
\item {\it control of systematics} is taken into account in the design of every
selection cut.

As another general comment from the simulation study presented in this section, 
it is useful to point out that the precision Higgs measurements 
are going to be much easier at a lepton collider than that at a hadron collider.
Table~\ref{tab:ILCEffSB} gives the typical signal efficiencies and signal over
background ratios (S/B) after final cuts. The difference with
LHC can be clearly seen using the example of $h\to b\bar{b}$ measurements
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LHCILCHbb}. The decay of $h\to b\bar{b}$
is discovered by ATLAS (CMS)~\cite{} after around 4 million Higgs events are produced
with a significance of 5.4$\sigma$ (5.5$\sigma$). In contrast, at the ILC, 
with only 400 Higgs events which will be produced with an integrated luminosity of 1.3 fb$^{-1}$
corresponding to around 2 days of running, the decay of $h\to b\bar{b}$ will be 
measured with a similar significance, around 5.2$\sigma$ according to the full 
simulation result~\cite{}.
