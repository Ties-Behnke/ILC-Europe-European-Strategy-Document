In this section, we make use of the simulation results presented in
Secs.~\ref{sec:higgs} and \ref{sec:ew} to present projections for the
uncertainties in Higgs boson couplings that will be obtained from the
ILC.  We will present projections both for the 250~GeV stage and for
the stage that includes at 500~GeV in the centre of mass, following
to the plan presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:runscenarios}.   


\subsection{Elements of the fit to Higgs couplings from Effective Field Theory}
\label{subsec:global:elements}
 


To extract
Higgs boson couplings from measurements, we will use the method of
Effective Field Theory (EFT) sketched in Sec.~\ref{subsec:phys_eft}.
This method has been explained in full technical  detail in
\cite{Barklow:2017suo,Barklow:2017awn}.
Here we will present an overview of the EFT analysis, supplying those 
technical details that are relevant to the evaluation of our fitting procedure.

In the EFT method, we represent the effects of new physics on the
Higgs boson and other SM observables by the most general linear
combination of dimension-6 operators invariant under $SU(2)\times
U(1)$.  In the most general settting, this formalism contains a very large
number of parameters.  However, in the special case of $\ee$
collisions, there are some simplifications.   First, for the purpose
of computing deviations from the SM due to dimension-6 operators, it
suffices to work at the electroweak tree level.   (The basic SM
predictions must of course be computed as accurately as possible,
typically to 2-loop order in electroweak couplings.)  Second, it
suffices to consider only CP-even observables, since the 
 contributions of $CP$-odd operators can be bounded
 by independent measurements.   With these simplifications, a total of
 16 operator coefficients appear in the analysis.  One additional
 parameter $c_6$ appears in double Higgs production, and 10 additional
 parameters appear in analyses of top quark production, but these do
 not enter the extraction of the Higgs couplings we will discuss here.

To determine
 these operator coefficients, we can use precision electroweak measurements and
 data on $\ee\to W^+W-$ in addition to data 
from Higgs processs.
   It is shown in 
\cite{Barklow:2017suo,Barklow:2017awn} that this data suffices to determine these
coefficients independently and without important 
degeneracies.\footnote{An 17th operator contributes to $G_F$
  but is controlled by constraints from the measurement of  $\ee\to
  \mu^+\mu^-$ at high energy.  The bound from LEP 2 is already very
  strong.}     We also make use of specific constraints from the LHC
that should be available when the ILC runs and have a clear
model-independent interpretation.  These are the ratios of branching ratios of the Higgs boson to the final states $\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ^*$, $Z\gamma$, $\mu^+\mu^-$.  The measurements of these four channels are all based on Higgs bosons produced centrally through the dominant gluon fusion process.  The ratios of rates should be extracted
 from LHC data in
a way that most systematic errors are common and cancel in the ratios. 

Here is an outline of the analysis. We need to fit 16 operator
coefficients plus 4 SM parameters which are shifted by dimension-6
effects.  The 16
EFT coefficients arise in the following way:  2 from Higgs boson
operators ($c_H$, $c_T$), 4 from operators involving the
squares or cubes of SM gauge field strengths ($c_{WW}$, $c_{WB}$,
$c_{BB}$, and $c_{3W}$), 3 from Higgs current couplings to leptons
($c_{HL}$, $c_{HL}^\prime$, $c_{HE}$), 5 from the operators that shift
the Higgs coupling to $b$, $c$, $g$, $\tau$, $\mu$, and two more from
Higgs current couplings to quarks ($c_{W}$ and $c_Z$).  

The parameters are
constrained rather specifically, in a way that we can outline.  Measurements of
$\alpha$ and 
$G_F$ and the $W$, $Z$ and $H$ masses constrain the SM parameters plus
one additional parameter ($c_T$).  Purely leptonic precision electroweak 
measurements ($\Gamma(Z\to \ell^+\ell^-)$ and $A_{\ell}$) constrain
two of the three $c_{H\ell}$ parameters, and measurements of the $W$
and $Z$ total widths fix $c_W$ and $c_Z$.   Measurements on $\ee\to
W^+W^-$ constrain  the third $c_{H\ell}$  parameter, plus $c_{WB}$ and
$c_{3W}$.    The LHC measurement of the ratio of branching ratios 
$\Gamma(h\to \gamma\gamma)/\Gamma(h\to ZZ^*)$ will put a strong
constraint on $c_{BB}$.   The Higgs branching ratios to fermion and
gluon states constrain those 5 parameters.  At this point, only the
parameters $c_H$ and $c_{WW}$ remain.  These are constrained, respectively, by the
normalized cross section for $\ee\to ZH$ and the polarization
asymmetry or angular distribution in this reaction.  

To account for the possibility of non-standard Higgs boson decays, we
add two more parameters to our global fit.  The first is the Higgs branching
ratio to invisible decay products.   This is independently measurable
at an $\ee$ collider using the $Z$ tag in $\ee\to ZH$.  The second is
the branching ratio to exotic modes that somehow do not correspond to
any category that has been previously defined.   Though it might be
argued that any Higgs decay mode above the $10^{-3}$ level of
branching ratio should be directly observed, we add this parameter 
as insurance against modes not yet thought of.  It is determined by the constraint that the 
Higgs branching ratios, including this one, sum to 1.

The ratio between the Higgs couplings to $W$ and $Z$ plays an
important role in the extraction of Higgs boson couplings and the
Higgs boson total width.   In the
$\kappa$ formalism, one parameter is assigned for each of these
couplings, and these parameters are determined independently  from Higgs production
cross sections.   This typically leads to very small errors on the $Z$
coupling and large  errors on the $W$ coupling.  In the EFT
formalism, as we have shown in Eq.~\ref{etazeta}, two
parameters are needed to describe each of these couplings, making the
$\kappa$ description oversimplified.   The
corresponding $W$ and $Z$ parameters are linked by
not-so-simple formulae involving other EFT parameters.  However, these
formula can be evaluated with the help of data from precision
electroweak and $WW$ reactions, leading to  constraints that are at
the same time tight and highly
model-independent~\cite{Barklow:2017awn}.  This is one illustration of
the synergies between different measurements that the EFT method
brings into play. 

It is remarkable that, though the EFT analysis introduces a large
number of free parameters, each one has a direct counterpart in an
physical observable that can be measured in the $\ee$ environment. 
In particular, beam polarization is very powerful in providing needed
information.  For example, in the EFT framework, the process $\ee\to
ZH$ involves three diagrams, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eeZhdiagrams}.
Only the first diagram appears in the SM.   The third diagram is
required to be small by precision electroweak constraints.  The second
diagram, with $s$-channel $\gamma$ exchange,  is generated the
operator 
corresponding to the coefficient $c_{WW}$.  Under a spin reversal $e^-_L
\leftrightarrow e^-_R$, the $Z$ diagram flips sign while the 
$\gamma$ diagram keeps the same sign.  Thus,  measurement of the 
polarization asymmetry  in the total cross section for $\ee\to ZH$
directly measures the $c_{WW}$ parameter.   Beam polarization plays
another important role.  With beam polarization, the branching ratios
of the   Higgs boson are measured for  two different   polarization
settings.   The statement that the same branching ratio must appear in
each pair of measurements helps to sharpen the global fit.  At the
same time, this comparison provides a check of assigned systematic
errors, as we will discuss in the Sec.~\ref{subsec:polarisation}.

The precise measurement of the triple gauge bosons couplings explected
at the ILC also plays an
important role in global fit.   We have described the measurement of
these couplings through analysis of $\ee\to W^+W^-$ in
Sec.~\ref{subsec:ew_WWana}.
The ILC is expected to improve the precision of our knowledge of these
couplings by a factor of 10 of results from LEP and by a similar large
factor over results from LHC.   Figure~\ref{fig:WWeffectonH} shows the
significance of this set of inputs.  In the figure, the results of our
global fit, in green, are compared to the same fit using as inputs the
LEP constraints on the triple gauge boson couplings.

From this analysis, we derive the projected uncertainties on Higgs
couplings shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:ILCHiggs}.  We emphasize that the
analysis leading to these projections is completely model-independent,
in the sense that all models of new physics describable either by the
addition  of local operators to the SM EFT (for heavy new particles)
or by the addition of invisible and exotic Higgs decays (for light new
particles) are included.  These estimates give the
current state of our understanding of the ILC capabilities.  Given the
run plan and  detector designs described above, we have a high degree
of confidence that these estimated uncertainties will be achieved --
and, probably, surpassed -- in the realization of the ILC program.
The projections in the table are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:ILCmodelindep}.

\subsection{Comparison of run scenarios for linear and circular $\ee$ collliders}
\label{subsec:lincirc}



In this section, we will present a comparison of the capabilities of
the ILC for precision Higgs measurement with those of other proposed
linear and circular colliders, including CLIC, CEPC, and FCC-ee.  We
will present three  sets of comparisons, organized in the 
following way:

To begin, each collider proposal has presented its own set of
projections in its documentation for the European strategy study.   We
have copied the relevant numbers for projected Higgs boson coupling
uncertainties into Tab.~\ref{tab:askthem}. 
For colliders other than the ILC, those estimates have been 
 made using the more model-dependent
 $\kappa$ fit.   The small values of the $ZZ$ coupling uncertainty
 relative to the
 $WW$ coupling uncertainty reflects the model-dependence in Sec.~\ref{subsec:global:elements}.

It is interesting to ask how the proposals would compare if a common
fitting technique is used. In almost all cases, the measurement errors
are dominated by statistics and the efficiencies used in the analyses
are similar.  A simple way to make the comparison is  to use
the results of our ILC analyses to estimate efficiencies and
statistical errors for all of the colliders.  That is, we  assume
the luminosity samples in the collider proposals, assume the same
measurement errors per unit of luminosity used to generate
 Tab.~\ref{tab:ILCHiggs},  take account of differences in
the cross sections resulting from the use (or not) of polarized beams,
and rerun our fitting  program for those conditions.   This is the
method used to generate 
Tab.~3 of Ref.~\cite{Barklow:2017suo}.  To model CEPC, we assume
 a sample of  5~\iab\ at 250~GeV without polarization; for 
FCC-ee, we use a sample of 5~\iab at 250~GeV plus 1.5~\iab\ at 350~GeV,
without polarization.  The run plan for CLIC includes only 1~\iab\ at
380~GeV before the energy upgrade to 1~TeV.  Since we are
unconfortable using the EFT formalism
 with dimension-6 operators only at 1~TeV and above, we represent CLIC by a sample of
2~\iab, similar to ILC, with 80\% $e^-$ polarization only, at 350~GeV.  
The results are presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:oursimple} and visualised in Fig.~\ref{fig:oursimple}.

 in the 
 FCC-ee CDR~\cite{Benedikt:2018qee} are used in all columns.   It
 would be interesting to add 2 columns with ILC + Gigaz.}
\end{table*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Though not all differences among the various proposals are included in
this table, it does usefully show how increased luminosity trades off
against beam polarization.   We see that beam polarization is a very
powerful tool, essentially compensating the advantage of larger event
samples claimed by the circular machines.   The comparison of 2~\iab\
data samples at 250 and 350~GeV is also interesting, since the two
energy settings bring different advantages to the Higgs physics study.


Finally, it is interesting to ask how improved precision electroweak
measurements affect these numbers. The answer to this question is
given in Tab.~\ref{tab:ournotsosimple}, which should be compared 
closely with Tab.~\ref{tab:oursimple}.   For the ILC columns, we have 
assumed that the input measurement of $A_\ell$, the polarization
asymmetry of the lepton-$Z$ coupling, will be improved by a factor 10
by measurement of the polarization asymmetry in $\ee\to Z\gamma$ at
250~GeV.   This is one of the improvements to our Higgs analysis
currently under study listed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:higgs_improve}.   The
improvement in $A_\ell$ by a dedicated ``Giga-Z''  run at the $Z$ pole
would be comparable~\cite{Baer:2013cma}.  For the third and fourth columns, we assume the
improvements in measurements of precision electroweak observables
described in the FCC-ee CDR~\cite{Benedikt:2018qee}.

Curiously, the ILC results with polarised beams are quite insensitive
to the improvement in the input $A_\ell$.   More surprisingly, though
the improvement in precision electroweak inputs makes a significant
difference for an unpolarised collider running at 250~GeV only, it
makes very little difference when a dataset at 350~GeV is added.  One
reason for this, pointed out in Ref.~\ref{Barklow:2017awn}, is that
the EFT coefficients responsible for precision electroweak corrections
also contribute terms of order $s/m_Z^2$ to the $\ee\to ZH$ cross
section.   It is easier to constrain these coefficients
by comparing Higgs boson production cross sections at different
energies rather than by straining to improve the precision of
measurements at the $Z$ pole.

% Figure~\ref{fig:polWIMPmanhattans} shows the 95\% CL reach in new physics scale $\Lambda$ for pair production of a light ($M_{X} = 1$\,GeV) WIMP mediated by a vector operator for different assumptions on luminosity, energy and polarization 
% as they are typical for linear and circular colliders. In particular the polarised
% configurations al refer to the ILC reference running scenario H20, see Sec.~\ref{sec:runscenarios}. Input to the limit calculation is the ILC study performed in full detector simulation of the ILD detector concept described in~Sec.~\ref{sec:searches}, and its extrapolation to other center-of-mass energies~\cite{Habermehl:417605}. The study includes a careful evaluation of the systematic uncertainties, comprising those on selection efficiencies, luminosity, beam energy (spectrum) and polarization as well as on the theoretical modelling of the background. The limit calculation uses a fractional event counting based on the 
% energy spectrum of the photon. It can be seen that at 250\,GeV, 2\,\iab\ with polarized beams offer a greater reach than 5 or even 10\,\iab\ without beam polarization. Even at a higher center-of-mass energy of 350\,GeV, about 10\,\iab\ of unpolarised data  would be required to catch up with 2\,\iab\ of polarised data at 250\,GeV. The higher center-of-mass energies reachable by linear colliders, in conjuction with beam polarisation, improve the reach considerably. For instance the reach of the full H20 running scenario of the ILC roughly doubles the reach in $\Lambda$ compared to the 250\,GeV stage.

Finally, we compare the capabilities of the ILC for precision Higgs
measurement to those of the HL-LHC.  Since the HL-LHC is approved,
while the ILC would be a new project, the ILC should be justified on
the basis that it will qualitatively advance our knowledge of the Higgs
boson over what is possible from the HL-LHC.  
This section will present several such comparisons.

To begin, we would like to stress that qualitative advantages that ILC
will bring to the study of Higgs boson couplings.

The goal of the ILC is not simply to achieve a high degree of
precision in the measurement of Higgs boson couplings; it is to
discover deviations of the Higgs boson couplings from their Standard
Model predictions and to demonstrate those deviations with a high
degree of confidence.  The strengths of the ILC program in this regard
are the
 following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ILC will report the properties of the Higgs boson in a
  highly model-independent framework.   Our estimate for the ILC capabilities
  are based on an effective field theory (EFT) model that includes
 {\underline{all}}\ dimension-6 operators that appear in the relevant physics
  cross sections at the tree level  (16 operators in all).   Our model
  also includes 2 further parameters to account for possible invisible
  and exotic Higgs decays.    The analysis includes a
  high-precision determination of the Higgs boson total width. 
 Thus, the ILC will be able to measure  the full array of Higgs 
boson decays and to detect and quantify anomalies in any aspect of this behavior.
\item  For the Higgs boson couplings to $ZZ$, $WW$, and $b\bar b$, 
the ILC will achieve 1\% precision in its initial 250 GeV
  stage.   This is the
 level deemed necessary to be sensitive to the typical predictions 
of the effects of new physics models on the Higgs boson couplings.
\item  If  anomalies are  discovered in the ILC 
250 GeV program, these
  anomalies can be confirmed with an independent data set by
  increasing the energy of the ILC to 500 GeV.   This second energy
  stage will improve the precision of the ILC 
determinations by about a factor of 2.  
\item The ILC, with Higgs bosons tagged by recoil against a $Z$ boson
  and with no trigger requirements, will be able to observe directly
  all manner of exotic Higgs boson decays that might be produced by
Higgs couplings  to  light, weakly coupled  particles.
\end{enumerate}
All of these features go qualitatively beyond what is possible at the 
LHC, or at any hadron collider.

Beyond these conceptual improvements, we can compare the ILC
capabilities quantitatively to the projections released in the HL-LHC
Yellow Report~\cite{Cepeda:2019klc}.  This  comparison is shown
in Tab.~\ref{tab:ILCLHC}.   The table, however, requires some explanation.

In our discussion of the inputs to our Higgs coupling fit, we have
stressed that all uncertainties are the result of full simulation
analysis of well-defined and realistic detector  models.   It is
always risky to estimate errors for experiments that have not yet been
constructed or taken data.   We have designed the ILC detectors to
have the 
superb performance characteristics detailed in
Secs.~\ref{sec:detectors} and \ref{sec:software}.   As far as is
possible today, these projected performances are justified by R\&D and
test beam measurements.   However, from this point, we wished to be
quite conservative, creating detailed software models of these
detectors, using these to create digitized data that includes
realistic detector response and instrumental and beam-related backgrounds,
analyzing this data using the best methods at our
disposal today, and using those results to provide estimates of our
measurement capabilities.   This is a level appropriate to an
experimental proposal, reflecting the stage where we are now.  We
promise to achieve the levels of precision that we have discussed
here, and we fully expect to exceed this expectation when a large
collaboration of physicists makes active use of the data that will be
produced by the ILC.

The projections in Ref.~\cite{Cepeda:2019klc} are created from a very
different basis.  These are projections based on operational experience
with detectors that have successfully  made measurements on the Higgs
boson, have exceeded their expectations from the proposal stage, and,
based on that experience, expect further improvements beyond the level
of their current methodologies.  These estimates are based on
extrapolation of current results.   They do depend on the assumption that the
detector performances will not be seriously degraded in the expected
high-pileup environment.   Nevertheless, these are the
expectations for the performance of the ATLAS and CMS experiments in
the HL-LHC program.

It is subtle, though, to compare projections based on two such
different philosophies.  The individual LHC experiments have actually
produced two sets of projections, a final one (S2) described above
and a more conservative one (S1) that includes the increase in
statistics from HL-LHC but uses only current methodologies and current
estimates of systematic errors.   We believe this more 
conservative set of estimates is more comparable in its methodology to
the analyses that we have described in Secs.~\ref{sec:higgs} and
\ref{sec:ew} and thus gives a better reference point for a sharp 
apples-to-apples comparison. 
  For this reason, we have presented 
in Tab.~\ref{ILCLHC}  both the S1
numbers from CMS and the final (S2) projections from
Ref.~\ref{Cepeda:2019klc}, which are ATLAS-CMS combinations. 

We call to the reader's attention the fact that the improvements
projected for HL-LHC from the current ATLAS and CMS uncertainties on 
the current uncertainties
the $HZZ$ and $HWW$ couplings are already very
significant in the S1 analysis.  This is because the high statistics
of the HL-LHC allows one to make use of the vector boson fusion 
production mode, which has a lower cross section but is relatively
clean among Higgs production modes at a hadron collider.
   On the other hand, the projected improvement in the $Hbb$
couplings is based mainly on a higher-precision understanding of
analyses such as that shown in the upper plot of
Fig.~\ref{fig:LHCILCHbb}.

For ILC, the projections in Tab.~\ref{ILCLHC} labeled S1* are those
from  Tab.~\ref{ab:ILCHiggs}  in Sec.~\ref{subsec:global:elements}.
While, as we have stressed, the ILC analysis is highly
model-independent, the LHC analysis relies on certain model 
assumptions that are difficult to
remove with only the constraints available at a hadron collider.   The
LHC results in Tab.~\ref{tab:ILCLHC} assume  that the Higgs boson has no decay
modes beyond those predicted in the SM, and they  assume that the Higgs
boson couplings to $WW$ and $ZZ$ are modified only by a rescaling.  In
the ILC EFT analysis, each of these these couplings depends on two
independent constants, called $\eta_{W,Z}$ and $\zeta_{W,Z}$, defined
in Eq.~\ref{etazeta}.   For a sharper comparison, then, we have then recast the ILC EFT analysis
adding these two assumptions, that is, assuming no
Beyond-Standard-Model decays and assuming $\zeta_{W} = \zeta_Z = 0$.
This gives the set of values labeled S1.

   We
have also included in the table the results of a more  optimistic S2
scenario for ILC,  including the analysis improvements that are listed
in Sec.~\ref{subsec:higgs_improve}.   These reflect improvements to our
methods that are under study by our group but are not yet completely
validated by full-simulation analysis.   We remind the reader that all
estimates quoted for ILC include certain specific inputs from LHC,
as explained in Sec.~\ref{subsec:global:elements}.

We hope that the Tab.~\ref{ILCLHC} provides sufficient information for
each reader to come to his or her own conclusion about the  expected relative
improvement of the ILC results over those projected for HL-LHC.
In all cases, however, it is the ILC results only that cross a
boundary into the region in which  we can robustly claim discovery of
deviations from the SM due to new physics.




Figures~\ref{fig:ILCmodelindep} and \ref{fig:ILCLHC}  thus illustrate the
capabilities of the ILC and the comparison of the ILC and LHC
projections.  Figure~\ref{fig:ILCmodelindep} shows the uncertainty
projections for the 250~GeV stage of the ILC, in the highly
model-independent framework S1*.  In the figure, these results are
compared to results obtained in the same framework with the addition
of data from an energy upgrade to 500~GeV.   This justifies the
statement made above that deviations from the SM seen at the 250~GeV
stage of the ILC can be confirmed with an independent data set after
the upgrade to higher energy.   Figure~\ref{fig:ILCLHC} shows the
comparison of the ILC projections in the S1 and S2 scenarios to the 
projections given for the S1 and final (S2)  HL-LHC projections given
in Ref.~\cite{Cepeda:2019klc}.
Note that, while the improvement from the S1 to S2 scenarios for ILC  is a
matter of conjecture, the improvement from the 250~GeV to the 500~GeV
values is based on completed full-simulation studies.
