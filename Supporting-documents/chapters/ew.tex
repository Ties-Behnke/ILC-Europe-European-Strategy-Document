% Intro, connection to Physics Case
The precision studies of the Higgs boson described in the previous section receive important and complementary support from analyses of 2- and 4-fermion final states which do not directly involve Higgs bosons, but our well-known SM gauge bosons --- or potentially their yet to be discovered siblings. In this section, some of the key examples introduced in Sec.~\ref{subsec:phys_WW}  will be discussed in more detail, highlighting the level of realism on which the projections are based.
