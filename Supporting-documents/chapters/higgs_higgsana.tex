\subsubsection{$m_h$ and $\sigma_{Zh}$}
\label{sec:higgs:sigmazh}
The signal processes are $\ee\to Zh$, $Z\to l^+l^-$ or $q\bar{q}$ and 
$h\to$anything. Thanks to the known four momenta of initial states, 
the four momentum of final state $h$ can be reconstructed 
as the recoil against the four momentum of $Z$, which is directly
measured from its decay products $l^+l^-$ or $q\bar{q}$. 
The mass of $h$ ($m_X$) can therefore be reconstructed as
\beq
m_X^2=s+m_Z^2-2E_Z\sqrt{s},
\eeq{eqn:recoilmass}
where $m_Z$ and $E_Z$ are measured mass and energy of $Z$
respectively. The signal events can hence be tagged without looking
at the decay products of $h$. This technique is traditionally called
{\it recoil mass} technique, and the two types of signal processes 
($Z\to l^+l^-$ and $Z\to q\bar{q}$) are called
leptonic recoil and hadronic recoil channels. The recoil mass technique
makes possible the measurement of the inclusive cross section of $\ee\to Zh$ ($\sigma_{Zh}$),
that plays a unique role in the determination of the absolute values of
Higgs couplings as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:physics}.
Meanwhile, the Higgs mass ($m_h$) can be straightforwardly determined by 
the $m_X$ spectrum. The detailed analyses for leptonic recoil channels
$\mu^+\mu^-h$ and $e^+e^-h$ and for hadronic recoil channel $q\bar{q}h$
can be found respectively in references~\cite{Yan:2016xyx} and 
~\cite{Tomita:2015,Thomson:2015jda,Miyamoto:2013zva}. For simplicity only the analysis for $\mu^+\mu^-h$ channel is illustrated in detail here.

The event pre-selection in $\mu^+\mu^-h$ channel starts with requiring at least 
two isolated muons with opposite charges and invariant mass ($m_{ll}$) consistent 
with $Z$ mass ($m_{ll}\in[50,130]$ GeV). 
It is well possible that one or two muons in such a candidate 
muon pair are actually from Higgs decay, for instance from 
$h\to ZZ^*/WW^*/\tau^+\tau^-\to \mu^+\mu^-+others$. To minimize the possibility of
this case, or to maximize the possibility that the candidate muon pair is 
indeed from the primary $Z$ decay, a strategy is taken:
when there are more than one such candidate muon pairs,
the pair which minimizes following $\chi^2$ 
\beq
\chi^2=(\frac{m_{ll}-M_Z}{\sigma_Z})^2+(\frac{m_{X}-M_H}{\sigma_h})^2
\eeq{eqn:chi2forleptonpair}
is identified as from the primary $Z$ decay. Here $M_Z$ is 91.2 GeV,
$M_H$ is 125 GeV, $\sigma_Z$ and $\sigma_h$ are resolutions for 
$Z$ mass and recoil mass reconstructions. 
After the pre-selection, the remaining background events are dominated by
leptonic and semi-leptonic decays of $\ee\to ZZ$, leptonic decay of $\ee\to WW$, 
and leptonic decay of $\ee\to \gamma Z$. 

In the final-selection, cuts $p_T^{ll}>10$ GeV and $|\cos\theta_{mis}|<0.98$,
where $p_T^{ll}$ is the transverse momentum of muon pair and $\theta_{mis}$
is the polar angle of missing four momentum, are applied to suppress
$\gamma Z$ background events. $E_{vis}>10$ GeV,
where $E_{vis}$ is the visible energy other than the muon pair,
and $m_{ll}\in[73,120]$ GeV
are applied to suppress $WW$ background events. 
$ZZ$ as well as $WW$ and $\gamma Z$ background events are
further suppressed by a dedicated BDT cut 
which is trained using angular distributions of each muon,
between two muon and muon pairs. After a final cut that requires
$m_X\in[110, 155]$ GeV, the remained signal and background events are 
shown in the $m_X$ spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:RecoilMassLep250} 
for the $Z\to\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, where the signal peak is clearly seen.
The overall signal efficiency is 88\%, with an
average signal over background ratio of 1/1.3.

The number of signal events and its statistical uncertainty are obtained by 
fitting $m_X$ spectrum with signal component modeled by a kernel function
and background component modeled by a third order polynomial, 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RecoilMassLep250}. As shown by the green histogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:RecoilMassLep250},
the signal spectrum has a 
considerable non-Gaussian tail in the high mass end, which is due to
the overestimate of effective $\sqrt{s^\prime}$ in $\ee\to Zh$ reaction 
when beamstrahlung and ISR effects are included, recall Eqn.~\ref{eqn:recoilmass}.
It's worth noting that these effects become so significant at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RecoilMassLep500},
that the measurement uncertainty could be underestimated by a factor of 2
if the effects are not properly included in the simulation.

\end{figure}

For $e^-_Le^+_R$, the estimate of relative 
uncertainty on $\sigma_{Zh}$ measurement ($\delta\sigma_{Zh}$) 
is 2.5\% for the leptonic
recoil channel, where the contribution from $e^+e^-h$ channel is
slightly smaller than $\mu^+\mu^-h$ channel due to the higher 
electron bremsstrahlung. For $e^-_Re^+_L$, $\delta\sigma_{Zh}$
is estimated to be 2.9\%. By combining the hadronic recoil channel,
$\delta\sigma_{Zh}$  is estimated to be 2.0\% for both $e^-_Le^+_R$
and $e^-_Re^+_L$, as shown in~\ref{tab:higgserrors}. 
The enabled measurement of left-right asymmetry 
for $\sigma_{Zh}$ plays a very important role in the EFT fit as
explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:physics}. 
The Higgs mass $m_h$ is also measured from the fit shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:RecoilMassLep250}. The estimate of $m_h$ uncertainty 
is 14 MeV for ILC250, with the dominant contribution 
from $\mu^+\mu^-h$ channel. 
The uncertainty in the Higgs boson mass ($\delta m_h$) does play a role 
as a source of systematic error for predictions of Higgs boson couplings. 
In most cases, $\Delta m_h\sim 100$ MeV 
would be already sufficient, but this is not true
for $h\to ZZ^*$ or $h\to WW^*$. 
It has been pointed out in  \cite{Lepage:2014fla} that 
\beq
\delta_W =6.9\cdot\delta m_h,~~~~\delta_Z =7.7\cdot \delta m_h,
\eeq{eqn:MassH}
where $\delta_W$ and $\delta_Z$ are the 
relative errors for $g(hWW)$ and $g(hZZ)$ respectively. 
At ILC250, the 14 MeV accuracy for Higgs boson mass results in 
systematic errors of 0.1\% for $\delta_W$ and
$\delta_Z$.

\caption{The efficiencies of the major SM Higgs decay modes,

of the $\mathrm{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}h}$
channel and $e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}$ at $\sqrt{s}$=250 GeV~\cite{Yan:2016xyx}.
The uncertainties due to finite MC statistics on these values are below 0.14\%.}
\label{tab:recoilmass}
\end{table}

As pointed out in the very beginning of this analysis, the key idea which enables
the inclusive $\sigma_{Zh}$ measurement is that the signal is tagged
independent of Higgs decay modes. Hence it is crucial to examine whether all
the pre-selection and final-selection cuts satisfy this criterion. This can be verified 
by checking the signal efficiency for each individual Higgs decay mode
and evaluating the efficiency uniformity among all the decay modes.
Table~\ref{tab:recoilmass} lists the efficiencies of major SM Higgs decay modes 
after all cuts in the $\mu^+\mu^-h$ channel. It is seen that there is no
discrepancy in efficiencies of SM decay modes beyond 1\%. 
This is not a surprise because the analysis strategies and selection cuts
are carefully designed to make it so. The cut $E_{vis}>10$ GeV may
deserve a few more words, since it apparently suppresses the 
$h\to invisible$ mode. The strategy behind is that $\sigma_{Zh}$ can be
measured as 
\beq
\sigma_{Zh}=\sigma_{Zh}^{vis}+\sigma_{Zh}^{inv},
\eeq{eqn:sigmazh}
where $\sigma_{Zh}^{vis}$ is the total cross section for all $h\to visible$
modes, which is measured here, and $\sigma_{Zh}^{inv}$ is the cross section
for $h\to invisible$ mode, which can be measured separately, described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:higgs:invisible}. A detailed and quantitative analysis taking into 
account the possibility of existing BSM decay modes is performed in~\cite{Yan:2016xyx}.
It concludes that the relative bias on $\sigma_{Zh}$,
induced by the Higgs decay modes dependence, can be
controlled at below 0.1\% (0.2\%) for the $\mu^+\mu^-h$ ($e^+e^-h$) channel,
which is much smaller than the
expected statistical uncertainty even at the full ILC250.

[t.b.f.: a few comments on decay mode independence in hadronic recoil channel~\cite{}.]

\subsubsection{$\sigma_{\nu\nu h}$ and $\sigma_{eeh}$}
The second leading Higgs production process, 
$\ee\to\nu\bar{\nu}h$ via $W$-fusion, provides a direct measurement
for $hWW$ coupling. It plays a crucial role in the global fit based on $\kappa$ formalism,
and still helps improve the global fit results based on EFT formalism even though 
the cross section is not very large at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV, 
$\sigma_{\nu\nu h}=$ 14 fb for $e^-_Le^+_R$. 
The signal channel used is 
$e^+e^-\to\nu\bar{\nu}h,~h\to b\bar{b}$, in which direct observable is
$\sigma_{\nu\nu h}\cdot BR_{bb}$. Together with $BR_{bb}$ measurement
by $Zh$ process, $\sigma_{\nu\nu h}$ is then measured.
The analysis is briefly described here, and more details can be found 
in~\cite{Durig:2014lfa,Tian:2017}.

  \label{fig:vvHbb}
\end{figure}

The signal final states consist of two b-jets and two missing neutrinos.
The pre-selection starts with vetoing events with one or more isolated 
leptons. Then jet-clustering and flavor tagging are performed with number of
expected jets equals 2. The two jets are required that in each jet there are at least 6
reconstructed particles and $Y_{3\to2}<0.1$, where $Y_{3\to 2}$ is the 
jet distance value from 3 jets to 2 jets step defined by Durham algorithm. The 
b-tagging of the two jets are required to be $btag1>0.8$ and $btag2>0.2$.
The di-jet invariant mass is required to be $m_{bb}\in[110,150]$ GeV.
The missing mass is required to be larger than 20 GeV.
After the pre-selection, the remaining dominant background events are
from $\gamma Z$ ($Z\to b\bar{b}$), $\nu\bar{\nu}Z$ ($Z\to b\bar{b}$) 
and $Zh$ ($Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}$, $h\to b\bar{b}$).

In the final-selection, $\gamma Z$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}Z$ background 
events are further highly suppressed by a BDT cut, which is trained 
using input variables di-jet mass, polar angle of di-jet, angle between
two jets, and $Y_{2\to1}$. The remained signal and background events
are plotted in the missing mass spectrum, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vvHbb} (upper).
The signal efficiency is 36\% and the average signal over background ratio is around 1/4.
The most dominant background events turn out to come from $Zh$ ($Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}$) and 
have significant overlap with signal events in the missing mass spectrum.
This is because the invariant mass of $\nu\bar{\nu}$ of signal events
can not be far away from $M_Z$, limited by available phase space at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV.
Therefore it is necessary to fit simultaneously $\sigma_{\nu\nu h}\cdot BR_{bb}$
and $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{bb}$. Note a useful constraint can be added into the fit
that $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{bb}$ is also measured 
using $Z\to l^+l^-$ and $Z\to q\bar{q}$ channels. 
As a result, the estimate of relative uncertainty on $\sigma_{\nu\nu h}\cdot BR_{bb}$
is 8.1\%, shown in Table~\ref{tab:higgserrors}, 
and the correlation between $\sigma_{\nu\nu h}\cdot BR_{bb}$ and
$\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{bb}$ is -34\%.

The left-handed beam polarization does helps significantly the $\sigma_{\nu\nu h}$
measurement here, simply because it enhances the cross section by a factor of 2.34.
The $\sigma_{\nu\nu h}$ can be measured much better at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, 
shown in~\ref{fig:vvHbb} (lower), thanks
to a fact of 10 increase on cross section and much easier separation with $Zh$ ($Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}$).

The third leading Higgs production process, $\ee\to e^+e^- h$ via $Z$-fusion, is not easy to measure
due to its very small cross section at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV. 
A full simulation analysis is performed and 
suggests that this process is already discoverable at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV
with $\sigma_{eeh}$ measured at a significance of 9$\sigma$~\cite{}. 

\subsubsection{$\mathrm{BR}(h\to b\bar{b}/c\bar{c}/gg)$}
The capabilities of precise measurements for $\mathrm{BR}(h\to c\bar{c}/gg)$ 
mark down another unique advantage of a lepton collider, enabled by:
clear separation between b-jet, c-jet and light quark/gluon-jet thanks to the
excellent flavor tagging performance introduce in Sec.~\ref{sec:software};
more importantly the democracy about cross sections between Higgs processes and
other SM background processes induced by electroweak interactions.
$\mathrm{BR}(h\to b\bar{b}/c\bar{c})$ offer important measurements of 
Yukawa couplings between Higgs and third/second generation quarks. 
$\mathrm{BR}(h\to gg)$ offers direct measurement of $hgg$ coupling 
using, complementary to that at the LHC. These measurements are performed
using the leading Higgs production process $\ee\to Zh$. All the major $Z$ decay
channels $Z\to l^+l^-$, $Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $Z\to q\bar{q}$ are used in the analyses,
see details in~\cite{Ono:2013sea}. [Here illustrated is the analysis procedure 
for $Z\to q\bar{q}$ channel, see Fig.~\ref{fig:qqHbbccgg250}, details t.b.f.].

The estimates of statistical uncertainties for $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{bb}$,
$\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{cc}$ and $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{gg}$ are respectively
1.3\%, 8.3\% and 7.0\%, shown in Table~\ref{tab:higgserrors}.

\subsubsection{$\mathrm{BR}(h\to WW^*/ZZ^*)$}
The measurements of branching ratios of $h\to WW^*/ZZ^*$ play an important role
in the global fit as the Higgs total width determined by
$$\Gamma_h=\frac{\Gamma_{WW}}{BR_{WW}}=\frac{\Gamma_{ZZ}}{BR_{ZZ}}.$$
Depending on how each $W/Z$ decays and how Higgs is produced, there
are quite many signal channels that can be used. [here describes analysis of one channel 
$\nu\bar{\nu}h, h\to WW^*\to 4 jets$~\cite{Durig:2014lfa}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:vvHWW500}, t.b.f.]

The estimates of statistical uncertainties for $\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{WW}$ and
$\sigma_{Zh}\cdot BR_{ZZ}$ are respectively
4.6\%, and 18\%, shown in Table~\ref{tab:higgserrors}.

\subsubsection{Higgs CP Properties}
\label{subsubsec:higgstautauCP}

Higgs CP properties can be measured via the
$h\tau\tau$ coupling at the tree level, 
\beq
\Delta{\cal L}_{h\tau\tau}=-\frac{\kappa_\tau y_\tau}{\sqrt{2}}h{\tau^+}
(\cos\phi+i\sin\phi\gamma_5)\tau^-,
\eeq{eqn:CPHtautau}
where the CP phase angle $\phi$ is determined using the transverse spin
correlation between the two $\tau$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qqHtautauCP} (upper). 
The spin of each $\tau$ is estimated using
the polarimeter vector which can be fully reconstructed in several $\tau$ decay modes,
taking advantage of precise measurements for impact parameters, see the method detail
in~\cite{Jeans:2015vaa}, and the analysis details using signal channels 
$Z\to q\bar{q}$ and $Z\to l^+l^-$ in~\cite{Jeans:2018anq}. 
[analysis illustration in $Z\to q\bar{q}$ channel, Fig.~\ref{fig:qqHtautauCP} (lower); t.b.f.]

The estimate of statistical uncertainties for CP phase angle is $4.3^\circ$ with full ILC250.

\subsubsection{Angular Analyses for Anomalous $HVV$ Couplings}
The $hZZ$ coupling can be deviated from SM not only in total strength but also
in Lorentz structures, which can be detected by measuring differential cross sections,
\beq
\Delta{\cal L}_{hZZ}=(1+a)\frac{m_Z^2}{v}hZ_\mu+Z^\mu+
\frac{1}{2}\frac{b}{v}hZ_{\mu\nu}{Z}^{\mu\nu}+
